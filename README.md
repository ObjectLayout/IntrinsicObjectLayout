IntrinsifiedObjectLayout
========================

This project holds examples of what Intrinsified versions of ObjectLayout code may
look like. It does not include actual intrinsification, so as to compile on
unmodified JDKs. But specific notes, comments, and in some places even java-based
logic is included to help make the last instrinsification steps simialr across
future JDKs that may choose to use this.
